The first line contains the following data:

	M N K G

Where
	M = number of tours
	N = number of vertices
	Q = number of persons
	G = minimum number of persons in a subgroup

The second line contains the starting point:

	i x y d S 0 C E

Where
	i = vertex number = 0
	x = x coordinate
	y = y coordinate
	d = visiting duration = 0	
	S = score of the location = 0
	O = opening of time window (start of the tour)
	C = closing of time window (end of the tour)
	
The next N lines contain the data of each point. 
For each point, the line contains the following data:

	i x y d O1 O2 O3 O4 C4 E b e1 e2 e3 e4 e5 e6 e7 e7 e8 e9 e10 

Where
	i = vertex number
	x = x coordinate
	y = y coordinate
	d = visiting duration	
	O1 = opening of first time window (earliest time for start of service)
        O2 = opening of second time window (= closing of the first time window = C1)
        O3 = opening of third time window (= closing of the second time window = C2)
        O4 = opening of fourth time window (= closing of the third time window = C3)
	C4 = closing of fourth time window (latest time for start of service)
	E = time windows normal or exchanged
		E=1: time windows 1 and 3 are used in tour 1 and 3 and time windows 2 and 4 are used in tour 2 and 4
		E=0: time windows 2 and 4 are used in tour 1 and 3 and time windows 1 and 3 are used in tour 2 and 4
	b = entrance fee
	ez = vertex of type z? 0 = no; 1 = yes.

The next Q lines contain the data of each person. 
For each person, the line contains the following data:

	j S1 S2 ... SN Bj E1 E2 E3 E4 E5 E6 E7 E8 E9 E10

Where
	j = person number
	Si = score of the location i 
	B  = budget limitation
	Ez = maximum allowed number of vertices of type Z	

The next Q lines contain the data that represent relationship level between persons in the group. Each line continas the relationship valuese of a person with every other person:
	
	Rxy = Relationship level between person x and y

The last Q lines define which persons should alwasy remaing together throught the trip. Each line continas Q boolean values that show whether e person has to be together with any of the other persons:
	
	Txy = Person x and y have or do not have to be together
        Txy=1 : Person x has always to stay together with person y
	  Txy=0 : Person x does not have to stay together with person y

* REMARKS *
	- The first point (vertex number 0) is the starting AND ending point (vertex number 1).
	- The first regular point has vertex number 2. 
	- The time budget per path (Tmax) equals the closing time of the starting point.
	- The Euclidean distance is used and rounded down to the second decimal.
